This zip file contains the following files:

ReadMe.txt - The file you are currently reading.

GeneticsSim1.xml - Data file to be used with program 1. This is not a fully
	qualified XML file so it cannot be opened with a standard XML reader.

	use to read and get data from the GeneticsSim1.xml file.

Prog1.txt - This is actually a demonstration executable file of program 1.  To run
	the program change the ".txt" extension to ".exe" and double click the .exe file.
